	abstract = {Dynamic simulation programes require hourly values of  solar radiation and ambient temperature forming large  files, which are usually difficult to handle with available  personal computers (PC). This report describes stochastic  models of these variables which have been constructed to  overcome this difficulty. They are based on Markov chains  and autoregressive processes, determined using multi-year  hourly data of both variables. A validation of the model  has been carried out for five different Swiss locations. It  has shown that the main statistical characteristics of  these variables are reproduced by the models. A very good  agreement was also obtained between results of dynamic  simulations carried out using measured and synthetic data.  The generalization of the method to 30 Swiss locations has  been made to facilitate the transfer of these developments  into practice.},
